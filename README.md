# Implementation-and-Comparison-of-Different-Modulation-Schemes
* Studied the effects of Pulse Shaping and Match Filter for QPSK, 8-PSK & 16-QAM modulation schemes. 
* The BPSK performed similarly to QPSK, 4x better than 8-psk and 6x better than 16-QAM when
 compared based on Symbol Error Rate(SER).
* The BPSK performed similarly to QPSK, 2x better than 8-psk and 4x better than 16-QAM when
 compared based on Bit Error Rate(BER
